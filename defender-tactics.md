1. **harden(training, awareness):** This function simulates defender actions to enhance cybersecurity posture using fuzzy logic. It takes training and awareness levels (0-100) and returns a security value increase. Fuzzy logic translates these crisp values into degrees of membership for categories like "low training." The function combines these degrees to create a "hardening factor" representing the overall impact of training and awareness. Finally, a random increase in cybersecurity value is calculated based on this hardening factor, reflecting the positive influence of defender efforts.

2. **detect(cybersecurity):** Within the cyber attack simulation framework, this function models the defender's ability to identify ongoing attacks. It utilizes the defender's current cybersecurity level, likely influenced by actions like `harden`, to estimate the detection probability. Utilizing a probabilistic approach, the function calculates a "detection chance" that increases with a more robust cybersecurity posture.

3. **isolate(cybersecurity, attacker_strength):** This function simulates the defender's actions to limit an attacker's movement within the network. It considers both the defender's security level and the attacker's strength to determine the effectiveness of isolation efforts. The function models this effectiveness, resulting in a reduction of the attacker's strength, simulating the defender's ability to contain the threat.

4. **deceive(cybersecurity):** This function simulates the deployment of deception techniques to mislead attackers. It leverages the defender's current cybersecurity level to model the effectiveness of deception. A higher cybersecurity level allows for more effective deception techniques, which are then simulated by a reduction in the attacker's strength.

5. **evict(cybersecurity, attacker_strength):** This function simulates actions to remove the attacker entirely from the network. It combines the defender's security level and the attacker's strength to determine the probability of successful eviction. The function employs a model to calculate an "eviction chance," leading to a reduction in attacker strength (complete removal if successful).

6. **restore(cybersecurity):** This function simulates the impact of system recovery activities after a cyberattack. It utilizes the defender's cybersecurity level before the attack to estimate the required recovery effort. The function models the resource consumption of post-attack recovery based on the pre-attack security level, resulting in a decrease in the current cybersecurity value. 

7. **model(security_data, threat_models):** This code implements a `model_based_defense` function simulating a proactive cyber defense tactic. It leverages pre-defined threat models and fuzzy logic with triangular membership functions (placeholder implementation). The input consists of security data (system state) and a list of threat models. Each threat model comprises relevant data points, corresponding membership functions (unimplemented), and a threshold for detection. The function iterates through threat models, calculating a score based on security data's alignment with the model's data points using fuzzy logic (to be implemented). Scores exceeding the threat model's threshold trigger the addition of the threat's name to a potential threats list and a simulated mitigation action. Finally, the code introduces a probability of false positives for realism. This approach offers proactive threat detection and efficient resource allocation but relies on the accuracy and maintenance of threat models and the proper implementation of fuzzy logic.
